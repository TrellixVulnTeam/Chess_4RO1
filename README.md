# Chess
This Chess game was created using pygame and a collection of different pictures on the internet. The objective of this project was to get more comftorable with both python and 
object oriented programming by creating different objects and housing them in different classes, and figuring out how they interact with one another. This chess game currently features 
a two -player game in which two people can play against each other on the same pc as different pieces, white and black. This game allows for all legal moves as in regular chess.
