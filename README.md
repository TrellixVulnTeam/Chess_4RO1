# Chess
This Chess game was created using pygame and a collection of different pictures on the internet. The objective of this project was to get more comftorable with both python and 
object oriented programming by creating different objects and housing them in different classes, and figuring out how they interact with one another. This chess game currently features 
a two -player game in which two people can play against each other on the same pc as different pieces, white and black. This game allows for all legal moves as in regular chess.

# Running the Project
This chess game can be run in any ide, and to open up the start of the game, ChessMain must be run.

# Project Functionality
Along with this game being a one vs one game between two people in chess, there are some functionalities that I added that include color indicator in spots to show whether a given move is valid or not, with yellow indicating a piece can move there, and red indicating you are able to take an opponents piece. After winning a chess game, the program displays who won the match, and offers two buttons in order to either play again, or quit.

# Work to add on
I want to continue building on this project, allowing there to be a computer to play against you in case you dont have someone else to play with on the same pc. Another functionality I want to add is to be able to change the difficulty of the computer.
